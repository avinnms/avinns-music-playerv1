a cute little music player for you to load songs on and enjoy! :)

To use this code to play music, you must either have a. a downloaded version of the song you want to play or b. the link to the song you want to play (via .mp3). Ensure that you've obtained the song in a legal manner (through copyright license, paying royalties, using opensourced audio files). From there, you must reference the file onto the playlist list in the playsync.js file using src:"linkhere.mp3", add a title, and go into the playlist you want it played on, change the <span> to the name of the music, and ensure the playSong(x) correlates to the spot on the playlist list you put the song on.
